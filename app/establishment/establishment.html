  <p>DRST supports Indian recognized non-profit organizations in their effort to establish self-help and training centers, schools and other educational institutions at different locations in India:
Training centers – DRST extends support to other non-profits for running the tailoring centers for women in rural and slum areas in India, so that needy women can make their livelihood by stitching clothes.
Schools – based on funds availability we are planning to help other non-profit organizations establish and run schools in rural and urban areas of India.
Other educational institutions – in the future, DRST may support Indian organizations to start vocational training centers and colleges in remote towns in India to help village students develop self-employment skills to support themselves.</p>
